The goal of the assignment to create  create a Regex-tutorial. This regex tutorial explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. I utilized a template provided in the starter code to create my  walkthrough.

Goals achieved
WHEN the regex tutorial is open,
there is a escriptive title and introductory paragraph that explains the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN the links in the table of contents are clicked on
It redirects to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN each section of the tutorial is read
 it redirects to a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
At the end of the tutorial
there is a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```
